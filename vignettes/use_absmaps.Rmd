The `absmaps` package exists to make it easier to download, compress and convert ABS shapefile data to `sf` objects to be used in R.

## Installation

You can install `absmaps` from github with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wfmackey/absmaps")
```


Additionally, the `sf` package is required to handle the `sf` objects:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
library(sf)
```

And we will use the `tidyverse` packages in this example:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```



## Maps loaded with this package

Available maps are listed below. These will be added to over time. 
If you would like to request a map to be added, let me know via an issue on this Github repo.
(Or send me an email: wfmackey@gmail.com)

More details about ASGS structrues can be found on the [ABS website](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS)).

### Downloading, compressing and converting an ABS shapefile

The `absmaps` package uses the `load_absmaps` to download and load a particular geospatial object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(absmaps)

mapdata1 <- load_absmaps(area = "sa3", year = 2011)

glimpse(mapdata1)

#> Variables: 12

```

The resulting `sf` object contains one observation per area (in the
following examples, one observation per `sa3`). It stores the geometry
information in the `geometry` variable, which is a nested list
describing the area’s polygon. The object can be joined to a standard
`data.frame` or `tibble` and can be used with `dplyr` functions.

### Creating maps with your `sf` object


We do all this so we can create gorgeous maps. And with the `sf` object
in hand, plotting a map via `ggplot` and `geom_sf` is simple.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map <-
sa32016 %>%
  filter(gcc_name_2016 == "Greater Melbourne") %>%   # let's just look Melbourne
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry))  # use the geometry variable

map
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("VIGNETTE-1.png")
```

The data also include centorids of each area, and we can add these
points to the map with the `cent_lat` and `cent_long` variables using
`geom_point`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map <-
sa32016 %>%
  filter(gcc_name_2016 == "Greater Melbourne") %>%   # let's just look Melbourne
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry)) +   # use the geometry variable
  geom_point(aes(cent_lat, cent_long))  # use the centroid lat and longs

map
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("VIGNETTE-2.png")
```


Cool. But, sidenote, this all looks a bit ugly. We can pretty it up
using `ggplot` tweaks. See the comments on each line for its objective.
Also note that we’re filling the areas by their `areasqkm` size, another
variable included in the `sf` object (we’ll replace this with more
interesting data in the next section).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map <-
sa32016 %>%
  filter(gcc_name_2016 == "Greater Melbourne") %>%   # let's just look Melbourne
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry,  # use the geometry variable
              fill = areasqkm_2016),     # fill by area size
          lwd = 0,                  # remove borders
          show.legend = FALSE) +    # remove legend
  geom_point(aes(cent_lat,
                 cent_long),        # use the centroid lat and longs
             colour = "white") +    # make the points white
  theme_void() +                    # clears other plot elements
  coord_sf(datum = NA)              # fixes a gridline bug in theme_void()

map
```


```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("VIGNETTE-3.png")
```


## Joining with other datasets

At some point, we’ll want to join our spatial data with
data-of-interest. The variables in our mapping data—stating the numeric
code and name of each area and parent area—will make this *relatively*
easy.

For example: suppose we had a simple dataset of median income by SA3
over time.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Read data in some data
income <- read_csv("data/median_income_sa3.csv")

#> Parsed with column specification:
#> cols(
#>   sa3_name_2016 = col_character(),
#>   year = col_character(),
#>   median_income = col_double()
#> )
```

This income data contains a variable `sa3_name_2016`, and we can use
`dplyr::left_join()` to combine with our mapping data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
combined_data <- left_join(income, sa32016, by = "sa3_name_2016")
```

Now that we have a tidy dataset with 1) the income data we want to plot,
and 2) the geometry of the areas, we can plot income by area:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map <-
combined_data %>%
  filter(gcc_name_2016 == "Greater Melbourne") %>%   # let's just look Melbourne
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry,  # use the geometry variable
              fill = median_income),        # fill by unemployment rate
          lwd = 0) +                # remove borders
  theme_void() +                    # clears other plot elements
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +            # fixes a gridline bug in theme_void()
  labs(fill = "Median income")

map
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("VIGNETTE-4.png")
```


## Why does this package exist?

The motivation for this package is that maps are cool and fun and are,
sometimes, the best way to communicate data. And making maps is `R` with
`ggplot` is relatively easy *when you have the right `object`*.

Getting the right `object` is not technically difficult, but requires
research into the best-thing-to-do at each of the following steps:

  - Find the ASGS ABS spatial-data page and determine the right file to
    download.
  - Read the shapefile into `R` using one-of-many import tools.
  - Convert the object into something usable.
  - Clean up any inconsistencies and apply consistent variable
    naming/values across areas and years.
  - Find an appropriate compression function and level to optimise
    output.

For me, at least, finding the correct information and developing the
best set of steps was a little bit interesting but mostly tedious and
annoying. The `absmaps` package holds this data for you, so you can
spend more time making maps, and less time on Stack Overflow, the ABS
website, and [lovely-people’s wonderful
blogs](https://www.neonscience.org/dc-open-shapefiles-r).



## How does this package do the-things-it-does

The `absmaps` package uses four key functions to do-the-things-it-does:

*  `utils::download.file` to download shapefile data from the ABS.
*  `sf::st_read` to read the shapefile into an `sf` object.
*  `rmapshaper::ms_simplify` to nicely compress the `sf` object.
*  `readr::write_rds` to write, and `readr::read_rds` to read our nice `sf` objects.

There are a bunch of other fiddley-things on top of that, but those four steps are the 'workhorse' functions. A big thanks to people who built them.

If you're interested, check out `load_absmaps.R` code in the `R/` file. And, of course, if you have a suggestion to improve, please do let me know via an issue at https://github.com/wfmackey/absmaps.



## I want to complain about this package

Fair enough\! The best avenue is via a Github issue at
(wfmackey/absmaps). This is also the best place to request data that
isn’t yet available in the package. You can also email me at wfmackey@gmail.com.
